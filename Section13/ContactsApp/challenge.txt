Create a simple contacts application that has a single main window.
The application will allow the user to add a contact, edit a contact,
and delete a contact.
You'll display the contacts using the TableView control

There will be a single Contacts menu that contains Add, Edit, and Delete items

The Application should be able to load and store the contacts


HINTS:
1. In addition to the ContactData class, you'll need a Contact 
class to store individual contacts. For each contact, you'll store 
the first name, last name, phone number, and notes.
2. To get data binding to work with the TableView, you'll want to store the
contact information as SimpleStringProperty fields
3. The TodoList application we worked on in a n earlier lecture covers
90% of what you'll need to complete this challenge.
