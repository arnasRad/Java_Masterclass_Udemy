Databases

Databese normalization - a process of removing redundant, duplicated and 
										irrelevant data from the tables;
The more this is done - the higher the normalization


type in cmd:
sqlite3 <db_name>;

example queries:
CREATE TABLE contacts(name TEXT, phone INTEGER, email TEXT);
SELECT * FROM contacts;
INSERT INTO contacts(name, phone, email) VALUES('Tim', 12345, 'tim.buchalka@myemail.com');
INSERT INTO contacts VALUES('Tim', 12345, 'tim.buchalka@myemail.com');
.restore testbackup
UPDATE contacts SET email="tim@myemail.com" WHERE name='Tim';
DELETE FROM contacts WHERE phone=1234;
.tables
.schema
.dump
.headers on
.quit




When columns are indexed, they can be searched much faster
Ordering of the rows is undefined in relational databases
Relational db theory is based a lot on set theory

Fields can be declared NOT NULL

autoincrement in SQLite: https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html

SELECT * FROM artists ORDER BY name <COLLATE NOCASE> <DESC, ASC>;
SELECT * FROM songs ORDER BY album, track;

SELECT albums.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs JOIN albums 
		ON songs.album = albums._id ORDER BY albums.name, songs.track;
INNER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN

* Ctrl+C - stop query listing (bug - might quit sqlite too)

* challenge.
	- produce a list of all artists, with their albums, 
					in alphabetical order of artist name.
SELECT artists.name, albums.name 
	FROM albums INNER JOIN artists 
		ON albums.artist = artists._id
	ORDER BY artists.name;
	
SELECT artists.name, albums.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs
	INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
	INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
	ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track;
	
* WHERE should go before the ORDER BY clause:
SELECT artists.name, albums.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs
	INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
	INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
	WHERE albums._id = 19
	ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track;
	
In cmd:
* copy - select text and press enter; 
* paste - Ctrl+V

Wildcards
SELECT artists.name, albums.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs
	INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
	INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
	WHERE songs.title LIKE "%doctor%" 		<-- wildcard. lists all the songs that has 'doctor' in a title.
	ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track;
	
SELECT artists.name, albums.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs
	INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
	INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
	WHERE artists.name LIKE "jefferson%" 		<-- artist's name starts with jefferson
	ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track;

* Stored procedures

Views
* can't insert etc., but can query them
CREATE VIEW artist_list AS
   SELECT artists.name, albums.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track;
   
SELECT * FROM artist_list;
SELECT * FROM artist_list WHERE name LIKE "jefferson%";

DROP VIEW artist_list;

* name view fields:
CREATE VIEW artist_list AS
   SELECT artists.name AS artist, albums.name AS album, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   ORDER BY artists.name, albums.name, songs.track;
  

DELETE FROM songs WHERE track < 50;
SELECT * FROM songs WHERE track <> 71;

Functions:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM songs;

Challenge:
1* Select the titles of all the songs on the album "Forbidden"
SELECT albums.name, songs.title FROM albums
   INNER JOIN songs ON albums._id = songs.album
   WHERE albums.name = "Forbidden";
   
2* Repeat the previous query but this time display the songs in 
	track order. You may want to include the track number in the 
							output to verify that it worked ok.
SELECT albums.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM albums
   INNER JOIN songs ON albums._id = songs.album
   WHERE albums.name = "Forbidden"
   ORDER BY songs.track;
   
3* Display all songs for the band "Deep Purple".
SELECT artists.name, songs.track, songs.title FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   WHERE artists.name = "Deep Purple";
   
4* Rename the band "Mehitabel" to "One Kitten". 
	Note that this is an exception to the advice to always fully 
	qualify your column names. SET artists.name won't work, you 
									just need to specify name.
UPDATE artists SET name = 'One Kitten' 
	WHERE name='Mehitabel';
									
5* Check that the record was correctly renamed
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name = 'Mehitabel';
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name = 'One Kitten';

6* Select the titles of all the songs by Aerosmith in alphabetical 
	order. Include only the title in the output.
SELECT songs.title FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   WHERE artists.name = "Aerosmith"
   ORDER BY songs.title;
   
7* Replace the column that you used in the previous answer with 
	count(title) to get just a count of the nubmer of songs.
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   WHERE artists.name = "Aerosmith"
   ORDER BY songs.title;
   
8* Search the internet to find out how to get a list of the songs 
	from step 6 without any duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT songs.title FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   WHERE artists.name = "Aerosmith"
   ORDER BY songs.title;
   
9* Search the internet again to find out how to get a count of 
	the songs without duplicates. HINT: it uses the same keyword 
					as step 8 but the syntax may not be obvious.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT title) FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   WHERE artists.name = "Aerosmith"
   ORDER BY songs.title;
   
10* Repeat the previous query to find the number of artists 
	(which, obviously, should be one) and the number of albums.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT artists.name), COUNT(DISTINCT title) FROM songs
   INNER JOIN albums ON songs.album = albums._id
   INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist = artists._id
   WHERE artists.name = "Aerosmith"
   ORDER BY songs.title;
   
   
JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
JDBC is like a middleman between application and datasource
* derby JDBC driver

Add SQLite JDBC driver to the project:
1. File -> Project Structure -> Libraries -> + -> Java -> *SQLite JDBC .jar file path*

We can connect to database using DriverManager or DataSource classes

Configure data sources for code assistance: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/database-tool-window.html

! Close all connections to the database once application finishes (close order matters)

A new statement instance is required for each select query statement
Statement object can only have one active result set associated with it

CRUD operations - Create Read Update Delete

SQL injection attack

querying tables by index (not field name) is more efficient

* Query Metadata

PreparedStatement benefits:
	* Potentaial performance benefit;
	* SQL injection attack protection
How to use PreparedStatement:
1. Declare a constant for the SQL statement that contains the placeholders
2. Create a PreparedStatement instance using Connection.prepareStatement(sqlStmtString)
3. When we're ready to perform the query (or the insert, update, delete),
	we call the appropriate setter methods to set the placeholders to the 
	values we want to use in the statement
4. We run the statement using PreparedStatement.execute() or PreparedStatement.executeQuery()
5. We process the results the same way we do when using a regular old Statement

Transactions
* transaction - a sequence of SQL statements that are treated as a single logical unit.
	If any of the statements fail, the results of any previous statements in the 
	transaction can be rolled back, or just not saved.

commit <-> save (when referring to making any changes permanent)

DB transactions must be ACID-compliant:
1. Atomicity
2. Consistency
3. Isolation
4. Durability

essentially transactions ensure the integrity of the data within a database

Used commands for transactions in SQLite:
1. BEGIN TRANSACTION
2. END TRANSACTION
3. COMMIT
4. ROLLBACK

if we close a connection before we commit any outstanding changes, the 
												changes are rolled back

Singleton pattern (for Datasource class)
We use it when we want our application to have only one instance of a particular class
