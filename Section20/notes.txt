Java Networking Programming

Network - a system of computers connected together so they can 
share resources and communicate with each other.

Networking - how the connected computers communicate

Intranet - private network

host <-> a machine or device that's taking part in networking

client/server - a common network configuration. One (or more) hosts 
on the network are acting as servers, and the other hosts are clients 
that connect to the server

local web development - run apache or IIS server

transport protocol - a protocol that's used for computers to 
communicate with each other. Example protocols: TCP, UDP.

Port:
Generally, a computer has one physical connection to a network. But the
same computer may be running multiple applications that want data from the
network.
Ports are used to route incoming data from the network to the target application.
Each application that needs data from the network is assigned a port
When data arrives from the network, the port number is used to route the data to 
											the application that's waiting for it
											
IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4). Uses 32-bit address scheme. Not enough for all 
		the devices on the Internet. Written as four integers and separated by dots.
IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6). Uses 128-bit address scheme. Written in hex and 
																separated by colons

IP (Internet Protocol)
TCP/IP - using TCP protocol with IP address
localhost 127.0.0.1 is usually used to identify the host when the client and server 
																are on the same host

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) establishes a two-way connection between hosts.
sequence of events when communicating using TCP/IP:
	1. the client opens a connection to the server
	2. the client sends a request to the server
	3. the server sends a response to the client
	4. the client closes the connection to the server
steps 2-3 may be repeated multiple times

socket - one end-point of the two-way connection. 
	Client has a socket and server has a socket

handshaking - specific messages that needs to be sent in order to establish a 
									connection between the client and the server
packet - data in specific format that's transmitted over the network
